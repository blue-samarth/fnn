# Explanation of the Fully Connected Layer (FCL) Class

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `FCL` (Fully Connected Layer) class implementation. The class is designed to be a custom neural network layer that can be used in a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model.

## Class Overview

The `FCL` class is a subclass of `nn.Module` from PyTorch, implementing a fully connected (dense) layer with customizable activation functions and Adam optimization for weight updates during training.

## Key Components

### Imports
The class uses PyTorch (`torch` and `torch.nn`) for tensor operations and neural network functionalities. NumPy (`np`) is also imported, likely for some numerical operations.

### Class Attributes
- `input_size`: Number of input features
- `output_size`: Number of output features
- `activation`: Activation function to use
- `m_weights`: Weights of the layer
- `m_bias`: Bias of the layer
- `v_weights` and `v_bias`: Second moment estimates for weights and bias (used in Adam optimization)
- `beta1`, `beta2`, `epsilon`: Hyperparameters for Adam optimizer

### Initialization (`__init__` method)
1. Sets up the layer dimensions and activation function.
2. Initializes weights and biases.
3. Sets up parameters for Adam optimization.

### Activation Function Selection (`get_activation` method)
This internal method selects the appropriate activation function based on the input string. It supports ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, and Softmax, with ReLU as the default.

### Weight Initialization
The weights are initialized differently based on the activation function:
- Xavier initialization for Sigmoid and Tanh
- He (Kaiming) initialization for ReLU
- A custom initialization for other activation functions

### Forward Pass (`forward` method)
Implements the forward propagation of the layer:
1. Performs the linear transformation (matrix multiplication of input with weights, plus bias).
2. Applies the activation function to the result.

### Backward Pass (`backward` method)
Implements the backward propagation and weight update using Adam optimization:
1. Calculates the gradient of the activation function.
2. Computes gradients for weights and biases.
3. Clips gradients to prevent exploding gradients.
4. Updates weights and biases using the Adam optimization algorithm.
5. Returns the gradient with respect to the input for the next layer.

## Adam Optimization
The class implements the Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimization algorithm:
- Maintains moving averages of the gradient (`m_weights`, `m_bias`) and the squared gradient (`v_weights`, `v_bias`).
- Uses bias correction to adjust for the initialization of the moving averages.
- Adapts the learning rate for each weight based on these moving averages.

## Key Features
1. **Flexibility**: Supports various activation functions.
2. **Optimization**: Implements Adam optimizer for efficient training.
3. **Gradient Clipping**: Helps prevent the exploding gradient problem.
4. **PyTorch Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with PyTorch's autograd system.

## Usage
This `FCL` class can be used as a building block in creating multi-layer neural networks. Multiple instances of this class can be stacked to create deeper networks, with each layer potentially having different sizes and activation functions.

## Potential Improvements
1. Consider moving the `get_activation` method outside the `__init__` method for better code organization.
2. The weight initialization could be moved to a separate method for clarity.
3. The Adam update logic could be extracted into a separate method to reduce code duplication between weight and bias updates.
